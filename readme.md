# Portfolio Page
https://garethdean.dev

This is my first portfolio page after graduating from the Northcoders November2023 software engineering bootcamp

Designed using “Progressive Advancement” "Mobile First" approach and using a single html page with navigation to allow for easy interaction.

Created using vanilla html and css, with some javascript and DOM manipulation to allow me to easily add to or amend my projects section with any changes or new projects,
